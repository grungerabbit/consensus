# Notes about what this might be

*November 2014*

Can we just start with something where:

someone posts a proposal (a one sentence summary/title and the details)
people check off on agreeing with it or post reservations/clarifying questions/proposed revisions to it
the proposer can accept or contest the revisions, answer the clarifying question, add a sentence to the end of the proposal that adds something that assuages the reservation, or agree with the reservation and revise the proposal completely, resetting the agree count

proposals on which consensus is reached become either to-dos for various people or policies. proposals therefore can be a list of to-dos, originally phased as 'someone will" and revised by individuals to be "I will" or "Matt will" or whatever

people can check off to-dos as they complete them



that can all probably be implemented before accounts are implemented. these things prob wouldn't be possible without accounts:

people can look at all their to-dos across accepted proposals, or group them by community or project

people can indicate whether or not they care enough about the proposal that they want to be able to agree with it before it is enacted

proposals can be grouped by common community or goal (garden club or we are building a clubhouse) or both. subcommunities/subgoals also possible



there's a lot more but this is tha basics
